### Questions:
1. What are common cyber threats, and how can they impact individuals or organizations?
2. What is encryption, and why is it crucial for cybersecurity?
3. How does SSL/TLS enhance the security of internet communications?

### Answers:
1. Common cyber threats include malware (viruses, trojans), phishing attacks, and ransomware. They can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and privacy violations.
2. Encryption is the process of converting information into a code to prevent unauthorized access. It is crucial for protecting sensitive data.
3. SSL/TLS are protocols that provide secure communication over a computer network. They encrypt the data transmitted between a user's browser and a website.

### Tasks:
- Research and identify a recent cybersecurity threat. Describe its impact and preventive measures.
- Set up SSL/TLS on a web server if possible, or understand how it's implemented.

  ### Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS:

| Feature                   | HTTP                  | HTTPS                       |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Full Form                 | HyperText Transfer Protocol | HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure |
| Encryption                | No encryption          | Uses SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication |
| Data Transmission         | Unsecured              | Secured                     |
| Port                      | 80                    | 443                         |
| URL                       | Starts with `http://`  | Starts with `https://`      |
