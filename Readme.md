# Cybersecurity Crash Course

## Week 1: Introduction to Basics
### Questions:
1. What is the primary goal of cybersecurity?
2. Name three common types of cyber threats.
3. Explain the role of an operating system in a computer.

### Answers:
1. The primary goal of cybersecurity is to protect computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage.
2. Three common types of cyber threats are malware, phishing, and ransomware.
3. An operating system manages hardware and software resources, providing services for computer programs and users.

### Tasks:
- Open the command prompt on your computer and use the `ipconfig` command to display your IP configuration.
- Navigate through folders using the `cd` and `dir` commands in the command prompt.

## Week 2: Networking Fundamentals
### Questions:
1. What is an IP address, and why is it essential in networking?
2. Differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6.
3. Explain the roles of routers, switches, and firewalls in a network.

### Answers:
1. An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network. It is essential for device identification and location.
2. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 was introduced to address the limitation of IPv4 addresses.
3. Routers connect different networks, switches connect devices within a network, and firewalls control incoming and outgoing network traffic.

### Tasks:
- Install Nmap and perform a basic network scan on your home network.
- Explore Wireshark, capture network traffic, and analyze the data.

## Week 3: Security Concepts
### Questions:
1. What are common cyber threats, and how can they impact individuals or organizations?
2. What is encryption, and why is it crucial for cybersecurity?
3. How does SSL/TLS enhance the security of internet communications?

### Answers:
1. Common cyber threats include malware (viruses, trojans), phishing attacks, and ransomware. They can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and privacy violations.
2. Encryption is the process of converting information into a code to prevent unauthorized access. It is crucial for protecting sensitive data.
3. SSL/TLS are protocols that provide secure communication over a computer network. They encrypt the data transmitted between a user's browser and a website.

### Tasks:
- Research and identify a recent cybersecurity threat. Describe its impact and preventive measures.
- Set up SSL/TLS on a web server if possible, or understand how it's implemented.

## Week 4: Practical Tools
### Questions:
1. Why is Python a valuable language in cybersecurity?
2. What is PIP, and how is it used in Python?
3. How can scripting be applied in cybersecurity tasks?

### Answers:
1. Python is valued in cybersecurity for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It is widely used for scripting, automation, and tool development.
2. PIP (Python Package Installer) is used to install and manage Python packages. It simplifies the process of adding external libraries to Python.
3. Scripting in cybersecurity allows for task automation, data analysis, and the creation of custom tools for specific needs.

### Tasks:
- Install Python on your computer and write a simple script to automate a repetitive task.
- Use PIP to install a cybersecurity-related Python package (e.g., requests, cryptography).

## Week 5: Cybersecurity Best Practices
### Questions:
1. Why is password management crucial for cybersecurity?
2. What are common signs of phishing emails?
3. How can individuals enhance their security awareness?

### Answers:
1. Password management is crucial to prevent unauthorized access. Strong, unique passwords and password managers contribute to better security.
2. Common signs of phishing emails include unexpected emails, requests for personal information, and urgent language.
3. Individuals can enhance security awareness by staying informed about the latest threats, attending training sessions, and verifying sources before sharing information.

### Tasks:
- Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords for your accounts.
- Identify and report a phishing email if encountered.

## Week 6: Capstone Project
### Tasks:
1. **Create a Simple Security Project:**
   - Develop a small security-related project, such as a basic intrusion detection system or a network monitoring tool.

2. **Research and Presentation:**
   - Choose a cybersecurity topic (e.g., two-factor authentication, zero-trust architecture) and research its importance and implementation.
   - Present your findings to a friend or family member.

3. **Q&A Session:**
   - Prepare a list of questions based on the topics covered during the crash course.
   - Have a Q&A session to discuss any doubts or areas that need clarification.
